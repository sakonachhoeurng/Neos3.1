=========================================
Automatically generated redirects in Neos
=========================================

Whenever you change the `URL path segment` or move a document node, a redirect will automatically be generated as soon as it is published into the live workspace.

.. note:: To get an overview over all currently active redirects you can always run ``./flow redirect:list``. For further details check the `Neos Command Reference`.

In the future, there will also be a backend module to show and manage redirects in the Neos backend.

Possible configuration for redirects
------------------------------------

You can configure the default behaviour for automatically generated redirects within ``Settings.yaml``.

.. code-block:: yaml

  Neos:
   RedirectHandler:
    features:
      hitCounter: true
    statusCode:
      'redirect': 307
      'gone': 410


Options
^^^^^^^

``hitCounter``
  turn on/off the hit counter for redirects.
``statusCode``
  define the default status code for redirect or gone status (node deleted).


It is also possible to add, change or remove redirects within the CLI.
The available CLI commands for custom redirect management can be found in the `Neos Command Reference`.
